Hi, I’m @ezzahiranass
I’m an architect, a self taught developer and computational design enthusiast!
I started using python to help me automate my 3D modeling workflows, but I fell in love with coding in the process.
Currently doing a PhD on Artificial Intelligence as a Parametric Designer.
I have worked on 70+ development projects as a freelancer, mainly in the field of 3D - creating Plug-ins for Blender, 3ds Max & Cinema 4D.
Also, I'm working on a few fun projects, Stay Tuned!
